A Game Engine based on Hazel made by The Cherno

just a fun project I am working on, adding stuff to it whenever I am free.
though most of the stuff I add are eventually added to the main engine so it doesn't make much of a difference xD

The end goal is a more extended and more polished version of the Hazel 2D since it's going to get discotinued at some point. And it will eventually support 3D as well (hopefully)
